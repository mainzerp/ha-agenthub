# Roadmap

Live pipeline in board format — headings are columns, cards are
`- title · priority: … · area: …` lines. The long-term idea backlog stays in
`TODO.md`; cards appear here only when work is scheduled or started.

## Backlog

- HA service for automations (ai_task-style contract) · priority: P1 · area: integration
  Outcome: HA automations can call the container via a service/contract without
  manual HTTP. Next step: define the contract surface (service schema,
  structured output). Verify: service callable from a real HA automation.
- Tech-debt and stability hardening · priority: P1 · area: core
  Outcome: daily-driver reliability protected; known debt burned down.
  Includes the legacy `agent-assist` identifier removal tracked in `TODO.md`.
  Verify: full verification gate passes; no regression on the live instance.
- User and agent memory · priority: P2 · area: memory
  Outcome: persistent user profiles with a memory tool (save/retrieve/update),
  limits/eviction, optional dashboard UI. Next step: design the storage and
  retrieval contract (session-memory lessons in Athenaeum `ha-agenthub` topic).
  Verify: memory persists across conversations and is controllable per user.
